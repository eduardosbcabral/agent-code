## Directory Structure

### üìÅ `python-examples/`
Python projects with intentional bugs and incomplete features for testing:
- `calculator.py` - Calculator with syntax errors (missing colons)
- `file_processor.py` - File manipulation utilities
- `data_analyzer.py` - Statistical analysis functions
- `tests/` - Empty test directory for agent to populate

**Test Scenarios:**
- "Fix the syntax errors in calculator.py"
- "Create unit tests for the calculator functions"
- "Add a factorial function to the calculator"

### üìÅ `web-project/`
Web development project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript issues:
- `index.html` - Basic website structure (missing contact section)
- `style.css` - Incomplete styling with layout issues
- `script.js` - JavaScript with bugs and missing functionality
- `package.json` - Node.js project configuration

**Test Scenarios:**
- "Fix the CSS responsive design issues"
- "Add a contact form to the website"
- "Debug the JavaScript button functionality"
- "Improve the website's accessibility"

### üìÅ `data-analysis/`
Data science project with datasets and analysis scripts:
- `sales_data.csv` - Sample sales data with duplicates
- `customer_data.json` - Customer information in JSON format
- `analyze_sales.py` - Sales analysis script (incomplete functions)
- `clean_data.py` - Data cleaning utilities (has bugs)

**Test Scenarios:**
- "Clean the sales data and remove duplicates"
- "Complete the customer analysis function"
- "Create visualizations for the sales trends"
- "Fix the data cleaning script errors"

### üìÅ `scripts/`
Utility scripts for common tasks:
- `file_organizer.py` - File organization script (has bugs)
- `system_info.py` - System information gatherer
- Various utility functions

**Test Scenarios:**
- "Fix the file organizer and test it"
- "Create a backup utility script"
- "Add error handling to the scripts"

## How to Use This Workspace

1. **Start the Agent Code** and point it to this workspace directory
2. **Choose a test scenario** from any of the projects above
3. **Give the agent a task** like:
   - "Fix all the syntax errors in the Python calculator"
   - "Complete the missing functionality in the web project"
   - "Clean and analyze the sales data"
   - "Create a new utility script for file backups"

## Example Commands to Test

```
"Fix the calculator.py file - it has syntax errors"
"Create unit tests for all the calculator functions"
"Add responsive design to the web project"
"Clean the sales data and generate a report"
"Create a script to find the largest files in a directory"
"Install the Python dependencies and run the data analysis"
```

## Expected Agent Capabilities

The Agent Code should be able to:
- ‚úÖ **Read and analyze** code files to identify issues
- ‚úÖ **Fix syntax errors** and bugs in the code
- ‚úÖ **Write new files** and complete missing functionality
- ‚úÖ **Install dependencies** using package managers
- ‚úÖ **Run tests** and execute scripts to verify fixes
- ‚úÖ **Create documentation** and improve code quality
- ‚úÖ **Work with multiple file types** (Python, HTML, CSS, JS, JSON, CSV)

Happy testing! üöÄ
