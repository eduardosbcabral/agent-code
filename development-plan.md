### Key Design Decisions
- **Async-First:** All I/O operations use asyncio for responsiveness
- **Sandbox Safety:** All file operations restricted to specified directory
- **Transparent AI:** Show reasoning process to build user trust
- **Structured Output:** Clear separation of thoughts, actions, and results
- **Error Recovery:** Graceful handling of API failures and invalid commands

## 📋 Notes & Decisions Log

### Design Decisions:
- Chose `rich` over alternatives for better terminal formatting capabilities
- Implemented async-first architecture for better user experience during API calls
- Simplified command set by removing web search to focus on core file operations
- Focused on local development workflow with terminal command execution

### Technical Challenges Identified:
- Need robust error handling for API rate limits
- Command parsing must be flexible yet secure
- Context management for large projects needs optimization
- Sandbox security requires careful path validation

### Questions to Resolve:
- Maximum context size handling for large projects
- Optimal conversation history pruning strategy
- Terminal command security and sandboxing considerations
- User authentication/API key management approach
