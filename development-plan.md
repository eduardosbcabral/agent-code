## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Sprint 1)

### Week 1 Focus: Foundation
1. **Project Setup** - Create directory structure and virtual environment
2. **Dependencies** - Install and configure all required packages
3. **API Setup** - Get Gemini and Google Search API credentials working
4. **Basic Structure** - Create main.py with initialization logic

### Success Criteria for Sprint 1:
- [x] Virtual environment created and activated
- [x] All dependencies installed via requirements.txt
- [x] API credentials configured and tested
- [x] Basic main.py that can initialize and prompt for directory
- [x] Docker setup with Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
- [x] Project context builder can scan a directory

### Key Design Decisions
- **Async-First:** All I/O operations use asyncio for responsiveness
- **Sandbox Safety:** All file operations restricted to specified directory
- **Transparent AI:** Show reasoning process to build user trust
- **Structured Output:** Clear separation of thoughts, actions, and results
- **Error Recovery:** Graceful handling of API failures and invalid commands

## 📋 Notes & Decisions Log

### Design Decisions:
- Chose `rich` over alternatives for better terminal formatting capabilities
- Implemented async-first architecture for better user experience during API calls
- Simplified command set by removing web search to focus on core file operations
- Focused on local development workflow with terminal command execution

### Technical Challenges Identified:
- Need robust error handling for API rate limits
- Command parsing must be flexible yet secure
- Context management for large projects needs optimization
- Sandbox security requires careful path validation

### Questions to Resolve:
- Maximum context size handling for large projects
- Optimal conversation history pruning strategy
- Terminal command security and sandboxing considerations
- User authentication/API key management approach
