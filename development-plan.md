## 🎯 Architecture Decisions Made

### Tool-Based Design Rationale
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each tool has one clear purpose
2. **Dependency Injection**: Tools receive workspace path at initialization
3. **Consistent Interface**: All tools return Dict[str, Any] with success/error patterns
4. **Shared Utilities**: PathResolver prevents code duplication
5. **Easy Testing**: Tools can be unit tested independently

### Security Considerations
- **Path Sandboxing**: All file operations restricted to workspace
- **Input Validation**: File paths validated before processing
- **Command Timeouts**: Terminal commands limited to 30 seconds
- **Error Isolation**: Tool failures don't crash the main system

### Performance Optimizations
- **Async Operations**: All I/O operations are asynchronous
- **Lazy Loading**: Tools initialized only when needed
- **Memory Efficiency**: Large file operations use streaming
- **Caching**: Context information cached between operations

## 🔧 Technical Debt & Known Issues

### Minor Issues (Low Priority)
- [ ] Some import warnings in tool files (aiofiles not resolved by linter)
- [ ] Could add more comprehensive logging across tools
- [ ] Error messages could be more user-friendly in some edge cases

### Enhancement Opportunities (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Add configuration system for tool-specific settings
- [ ] Implement tool execution metrics and performance monitoring
- [ ] Add plugin system for external tool development
- [ ] Create comprehensive integration tests for tool combinations

### Future Architecture Considerations (Low Priority)
- [ ] Consider tool registry pattern for dynamic tool discovery
- [ ] Evaluate dependency injection container for tool management
- [ ] Assess message passing between tools for complex workflows
- [ ] Design tool chaining/pipeline system for automated sequences
