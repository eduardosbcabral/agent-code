Optimize the website for performance and add proper meta tags
```

## üìä Data Analysis Scenarios

### Data Cleaning & Processing
```
Clean the sales data in data-analysis/sales_data.csv by removing duplicates and fixing data types
```

```
Process the customer data and merge it with sales data for comprehensive analysis
```

```
Handle missing values and outliers in the dataset using appropriate statistical methods
```

### Analysis & Insights
```
Analyze the sales data to find the top 10 customers by revenue and create a summary report
```

```
Generate monthly sales trends and identify seasonal patterns in the data
```

```
Calculate customer lifetime value and segment customers into different categories
```

### Visualization & Reporting
```
Create visualizations for the sales data showing revenue trends, product performance, and customer distribution
```

```
Generate a comprehensive sales report in both CSV and HTML formats
```

```
Build an interactive dashboard to explore the sales and customer data
```

## üîß System Administration & Utilities

### File Management
```
Create a backup utility script that can archive important project files
```

```
Build a file cleanup tool that removes temporary files and organizes project directories
```

```
Develop a script to find and analyze large files across the workspace
```

### System Monitoring
```
Enhance the system_info.py script to include more detailed hardware and software information
```

```
Create a log analyzer that can parse and summarize system logs
```

### Automation Scripts
```
Write a deployment script that can package and prepare projects for production
```

```
Create a project initialization script that sets up new project structures
```

## üß™ Complex Multi-Step Scenarios

### Full Project Analysis
```
Analyze the entire workspace, identify all issues across all projects, create a priority list, and fix the most critical problems first
```

### End-to-End Development
```
Take the web project from its current state to a fully functional, deployed website with proper testing and documentation
```

### Data Pipeline Creation
```
Build a complete data processing pipeline: clean the sales data, perform analysis, generate insights, create visualizations, and produce an automated report
```

### Code Quality Improvement
```
Review all Python code in the workspace, add proper error handling, write comprehensive tests, improve documentation, and ensure PEP 8 compliance
```

## üéØ Performance & Optimization Tests

### Large File Handling
```
Generate a large dataset (10,000+ rows) and test the data analysis scripts' performance
```

### Concurrent Operations
```
Create multiple files simultaneously and test the agent's ability to handle parallel tasks
```

### Error Recovery
```
Introduce intentional errors in files and test how well the agent can diagnose and recover from failures
```

## üé® Creative & Open-Ended Prompts

### Feature Innovation
```
Design and implement a new feature for the calculator that would make it more useful for students
```

### Project Extension
```
Extend the web project with a new page that showcases the data analysis results in an interactive format
```

### Integration Challenges
```
Create a unified system that connects the web project with the data analysis tools to display live data
```

### Documentation & Tutorials
```
Write comprehensive documentation for the entire workspace that would help a new developer get started
```

## üö® Edge Cases & Stress Tests

### Error Handling
```
Test what happens when you try to read a non-existent file, write to a protected directory, or run invalid commands
```

### Large Context
```
Provide a very complex, multi-part request that requires the agent to maintain context across many steps
```

### Resource Limitations
```
Work with the largest files in the workspace and see how the agent handles memory and processing constraints
```

## üí° Tips for Effective Prompting

### Be Specific
- Instead of "fix the code", say "fix the syntax errors in calculator.py"
- Specify the desired outcome: "create unit tests that achieve 100% code coverage"

### Provide Context
- Mention the project type: "In the data analysis project..."
- Specify constraints: "without using external libraries"

### Use Progressive Complexity
- Start simple: "List the files"
- Build up: "Analyze the code quality"
- Go complex: "Refactor the entire codebase"

### Test Edge Cases
- Ask for impossible things to test error handling
- Provide conflicting requirements to test decision-making
- Request very large or complex operations to test limits

## üé™ Demo-Ready Scenarios

Perfect for showcasing the Agent Code's capabilities:

### 5-Minute Demo
```
Fix the calculator syntax errors, add a new square root function, create tests for it, and run them to verify everything works
```

### 10-Minute Demo
```
Clean the sales data, analyze customer trends, create visualizations, and generate a professional report with insights and recommendations
```

### 15-Minute Demo
```
Transform the basic web project into a modern, responsive website with improved styling, interactive features, and integration with the data analysis results
```

### Ultimate Challenge (30+ minutes)
```
Create a complete web-based data dashboard: fix all existing issues, integrate the web project with data analysis, add real-time features, write comprehensive tests, and prepare it for deployment
```

## üîÑ How to Use These Prompts

1. **Copy and paste** any prompt directly into the Agent Code
2. **Modify the prompts** to match your specific needs
3. **Combine multiple prompts** for complex workflows
4. **Use as inspiration** to create your own custom scenarios

Remember: The Agent Code works best with clear, specific instructions. Feel free to iterate and refine your prompts based on the results you get!

Happy coding! üöÄ
